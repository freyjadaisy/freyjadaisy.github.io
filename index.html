<h3 id="What to feed them">What to feed them</h3>
  Guinea pigs love a range of food, but there are a few things that you should NOT give your guinea pigs. They are herbivores, which means they will not and should <em><b>not</b></em> eat any <b>meat</b>. However they do <b>LOVE</b> <em>fruits and vegetables</em>, that you should feed them along with their <em>hay and pellets</em>, to give them necessery vitamins. Some of their favourites are lettuce, carrots, apple, celery and many more. You can give your guinea pigs many scraps of fruits and veggies that you have, like carrot and strawberry tops. However, <b>NEVER</b> feed them <em>cooked food</em>. Some of the sweeter fruits, like <em>grapes and watermelon,</em> are quite sugary for a guinea pig. Because of this, you should only feed them <b>small quantaties</b> once in a while. They can eat most fruits and veggies, but there are a few that are poisonous for them. Like potatoes. <em><b>NEVER give your guinea any part of a potato</b></em>. Other vegetables that you should not feed your pet include onions, and avacacados. Make sure you do not feed them any thing that you are not sure about.

<h3 id="Their noises">Their noises</h3>
Guinea pigs make many noises that can mean many things. One noise that they make is a kind of "week-week" sound, called weeking. They do this if they want food. Our guinea pigs often did this if they heard the fridge opening or a plastic bag rustling, as they know that it probably means they are getting food. They might also do this to call to their partner if they have been separated. Another sound called "chutting" that they make when they are running around means that they are contented and relaxed. Finally, purring. There are two types of purring, angry and happy. It is usually hard to tell between these two, but the angry kind is supposed to be more high pitched. If you are stroking there butts and they start purring, it probably means that they do not like it.

<h3 id="Training">Training</h3>
There are many tricks you can teach your guinea pigs. Ours easily learnt to stand on their hind legs. We taught them this by holding a peice of food above them and when they reached up to get it their front paws came of the ground and they were standing on their hind legs. We can now make them do this with just saying "hindy-leg standing" and reward them with food after. Also, you can make your guinea pig walk to you. You do this by holding a piece of food out in your hand when they are running around and they will walk to you and take the food out of your hand. If you do this often you will find that they will come to you to see if you have any treats. 
  As for toilet training, they do that on their own. When you first get them you will want to hold them in a towel. But as they get older they will train themselves to go only when they are in their cage. Ours even trained themselves to only go in the corners.

<h3 id="What they need">What they need</h3>
Unlike other pets, guinea pigs are easy to look after. There are a few basic things that you may already have, or you might need to get them:
<ul>
<li>Indoor/outdoor cage</li>
<li>Bedding</li>
<li>Water bottle</li>
<li>Food bowl</li>
<li>Guinea Pig pellets</li>
<li>Hay</li>
<li>Toys</li>
<li>Outdoor run</li>
<li>Fruits and Veggies</li>
<li>Love and cuddles</li>
<li>Their Guinea Pig friend</li>
For extra vitamins, you can get vitamin drops (liquid) from the pet store to put into their water.
  <h4>Indoor cage and outdoor run</h4>

  Guinea pigs like to have a few toys to play with (and eat), although it is not necessary. If you are going to get them toys they must be edible, as they will try and eat them. You can get chew toys and other objects at the pet store to help their teeth. You can also get tubes, logs, and other things that they can hide under (or in), which they love.

  <br />
     They like to hide in this toy that we got them, and as it is made of hay, they eventually chewed it all until it was gone. They also liked to play with and chew the ball, which is also edible and safe for them to chew on.

<h3 id="How to handle">How to handle</h3>
Guinea pigs love cuddles, but you must be careful with them and take care that you do not drop them. To pick them up, put one hand under their tummy, and another on their bottom.

<h3 id="Popcorning">"Popcorning"</h3>
You may have heard of guinea pigs popcorning. Guinea pigs do this when they are happy, usually when they are running around. It is a bit like a guinea pig skipping. If you see your pets doing this, it is definetly a good sign. 
  Here is an example from YouTube:

  <h3 id= "Inside or outside">Inside or outside?</h3>
You may be wondering if you should keep your guinea pigs inside or outside. Well, I would recomend for them to sleep inside, as you can keep them from over heating, or getting to cold. However, during the day, if you have a garden, you should get them an outside run (as shown above in the <a href="#What they need">What they need</a> section ) as they would like to run around and eat grass when they can. Of course they can also overheat when they are outside, so if it is too hot, then do not take them outside until it cools down a little. Once you are more comfortable with them, you could let them run around in your house. If you choose for them to sleep outside they can have an outside cage and even some insulation to keep them warm.
  Guinea pigs can overheat at a temperature of 26 degrees celcius (78.80 F). It is too cold for them at 15 degrees celcius (59 F).

<h3 id= "Meet Moose and Bison">Meet Moose and Bison</h3>
Here I will tell you about Moose and Bison, the adorable piggies that you can see on the top of this page. They are two female classic American guinea pigs. Moose has black, brown, and white fur, while Bison has brown and black. 
<br/>
  <img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-dlFobQqPbLg/XzMIQlGdLwI/AAAAAAAAA1I/cPldWpK9MEMoSZeo1c72qfsTcQ6bMtnPQCK8BGAsYHg/s0/2020-08-11.jpg">
<br/> Bison is on the left and Moose is on the right.
<br> Like all guinea pigs, they both have their own unique personalities. Moose is a little more stubborn, and energetic. On the other hand Bison is calm and doesn't like to move when she doesn't need too. She prefers to sit on your lap and let you feed her. 
  They also have their own ways of communicating. While Moose nibbles you when she wants you to put her back into their home, Bison will complain (talked about in the video in the <a href="#Their noises"> Their noises</a> section). Also, Moose licks people a lot more than Bison, especially when you stroke her neck. 
  We let them run around in our house in the mornings, and they had the freedom to explore our whole bottom floor (they couldn't go up the stairs!). They loved this freedom and as long as there are no wires and things that they can reach and chew, they do not get into too much trouble. When they are doing this, they always follow each other, and Bison is usually in the lead. It is really funny watching them because they butts move when they walk and they make a funny chutting sound, almost like they are talking to themselves. They also popcorn when they are running around, which is really cute. (Check out the <a href="#Popcorning"> Popcorning</a> section).
